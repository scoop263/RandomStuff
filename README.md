# RandomStuff
A Repo that has no designated purpose

As AnimaRandomizer is only in it, all the files/ folders except the script, must be put into a parent folder called "Properties"
While AnimaRandomizer must be in the same directory as the "Properties" Folder, Blame git hub Im uploading
everything through the browser.
